# Examples

* **express:** Vanilla `graphql` using `express`.
* **graphql-tools:** Using `graphql-tools` to define the schema through the schema definition language.
* **apollo:** `apollo-server` implementation. Currently doesn't support projection due to conflict with the package.

Run with `docker-compose up` to start with a paired MongoDb image, or enter a new connection string in `db.ts` and run `yarn start`.

**Note:** There are currently two solutions to integrate the package with the sdl, neither is entirely elegant. Suggestions for improvement are welcome.
